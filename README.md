Confluence API Integration

Introduction

The purpose of this repo is to migrate forum data from Wordpress to Confluence built using Microsoft Windows Forms.
Due to tight schedule, more emphasis was given to get the job done rather than beautiful UI.

Functionalities include
- Connect to MySql database and read relevant information such as users, topics, user posts, chat history etc. from forum tables
- Massage and format the data into valid HTML 
- Populate data using Web APIs into related forum tables for Confluence
